# This play promotes the configured Content Views and Composite Content Views to the specified life cycle environments
# This is intended for periodic scheduled view promotion rather than CV/CCV general maintenance.
# This is intended for use with an Ansible Automation Platform Workflow
# In a workflow model we will call this role multiple times with different configurations during the workflow
# as we build systems and perform various tests.
